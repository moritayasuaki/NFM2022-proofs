# Prerequisites

This implementation requires
+ Agda version 2.6.22
+ The Agda standard library version 1.7.1

The formalization and related proofs are contained in a single file named `MiniWasm.agda` and can be checked by running `agda MiniWasm.agda`.
To read through the formalization, you can use emacs (or any other editors) with interactive support for Agda.
